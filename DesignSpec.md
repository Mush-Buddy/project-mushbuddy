## What is Mush-buddy at its core
Mush-buddy will be multiplatform app that will allow users to look up mushrooms to help identify it, have their own personal collection of mushrooms in a digital library, and be more social by allowing community interactions

### Core Functions of Mush-buddy

- Mushroom Identification 
    - Based on 10 Characterstics so far:
        -*Location*
        -*Season (time of year)*
        -*shape of stem*
        -*shape of cap*
        -*color of stem*
        -*color of cap*
        -*spore print*
        -*shape of gills*
        -*bruising (how the flesh color progresses after lesions)*
        -*veil*
- Community Building
    - The ability to make posts (geographically so far) but could expand to a stream of feed including picture and names of potential mushrooms
    - the ability to ask questions to more knowledgeable members
    - posts may be seperated by kind:
        -*help with indetifcation*
        -*crazy finds*
        -*questions for good hikes to find mushrooms*
    - submittion for approval? 
    - template for posting with mushroom identification guidelines above
- Personalization
    - able to create personalized profiles which may include
    *profile picture maybe from a collection set*, *general location (nothing too specific for safety concerns)*, *mushroom badges*, and *a list with geo tags and their submitted posts for where they found mushrooms*

    - Sources
        - A list of credits, sourcee
    - explore/ tutorial links?
        - a list of weebsites, books, videos, to explore?


## Privacy and Precautions
Below are a few privacy concerns so far to keep in mind throughout the design process:
- personal login in information
    - what we will be asking for:
        - location enabling, but we dont want to be too specific?
        - name, how are going to be structuring profiles
            - anonymous names?
            - more personal?
            - are there any safety concerns with this?
- Chat disclaimer for posting
    - how are we going to manage online harassment and bullying? (apple will ask this question I am pretty sure)
        - a way to filter out language behaviors?
- should there be an age limit for this application?
    - yes, because this app could have heavy social and health implications
    - what is the age suggestion for this application? (up for discussion)

## Important Safety Disclaimer
**Above all**, ***we must stress that one must never eat a mushroom they arent 100% sure of***. Mushroom Identification is indeed a gamble. Many can look similiar to poisonous relatives. This app must *NOT* gaurantee identification of any mushrooms species, merely suggest kinds of mushrooms, and *even better* suggest poisonous look alikes.

## Current Concerns
- how are we going to build the communities/sub communities
- how to post
- profile creation
